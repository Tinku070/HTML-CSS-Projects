HTML Files: These are the foundational files that provide the structure and content for each website. Within each project folder (e.g., Hotel_Website, Newsgrid, Knowledge_resume), you would find an index.html file or similar HTML files. These files would contain the text, images, and other elements of the web page, all marked up with HTML tags.

CSS Files: These files are responsible for the styling and presentation of the HTML content. In each of your project folders, there is likely a styles.css, main.css, or other CSS file. These files contain rules that define the colors, fonts, layouts (like the css_grid_sandbox and Newsgrid folders), and other visual aspects of the website. The CSS files are linked to the HTML files to apply the styling.

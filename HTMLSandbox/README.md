# HTML Sandbox

This is a practice folder focused on experimenting with HTML structure. The files here contain various HTML tags, forms, tables, and semantic elements for testing purposes. Styling is minimal, as the primary goal is to understand HTML's role in providing content and structure.

## How to View
Open any of the `*.html` files directly in your browser to see the output of the HTML code.

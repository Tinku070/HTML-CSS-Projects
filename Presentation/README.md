# Web Presentation Project

This project might be a simple web-based presentation or a visually driven landing page. The HTML is structured in "slides," and the CSS handles the visual transitions and overall styling to create a compelling display.

## Key Files
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file containing the content for each "slide."
- **`styles.css`**: The stylesheet that defines the layout and visual effects.

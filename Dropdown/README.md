# Dropdown Menu Project

This project focuses on creating a functional and styled dropdown menu. It demonstrates how to build a nested list structure in HTML and style it with CSS to create a hover or click-activated menu.

## Key Components
- **`index.html`**: Contains the navigation bar and the HTML structure for the dropdown list.
- **`styles.css`**: Styles the menu, including the hover effects to show and hide the dropdown.
- **`script.js` (if applicable)**: A small JavaScript file may be used to handle click events for the dropdown.

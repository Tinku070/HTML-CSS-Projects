# Hamburger Menu Project

This project is a small, focused demonstration of building a responsive "hamburger" menu, a common UI element for mobile navigation.

## Key Files
- **`index.html`**: Contains the HTML for the menu icon and the navigation links.
- **`styles.css`**: Styles the menu icon and handles the animations for showing/hiding the navigation.
- **`script.js`**: Manages the click event to toggle the menu's open/closed state.

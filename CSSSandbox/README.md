# CSS Sandbox Projects

This repository contains two general-purpose "sandbox" projects for practicing various CSS skills.

## Projects
- **`CSSsandbox`**: A collection of small, independent files for testing CSS properties, selectors, and styling techniques.
- **`CSSSANDBOX2`**: A second set of experiments, separate from the first sandbox.

## How to View
Each file is a separate experiment. Simply open any of the `*.html` files in your browser to see the corresponding styles.

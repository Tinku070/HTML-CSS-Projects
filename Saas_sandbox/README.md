# SaaS Sandbox Project

This project focuses on building the front-end design for a Software as a Service (SaaS) website. It explores UI elements common in SaaS products, such as pricing tables, feature lists, and sign-up forms.

## Key Files
- **`index.html`**: The HTML structure for the SaaS landing page.
- **`css/style.css`**: The stylesheet for the project. This folder might also contain Sass files (`.scss`) if a preprocessor was used.
